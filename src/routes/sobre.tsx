          FIG is a digital marketing studio based in Rotterdam, helping brands grow through
          strategy, content, paid visibility and digital presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work as strategic partners, not just executors. That means we think alongside
          our clients, understand what makes their brand meaningful, and create marketing
          that feels clear, intentional and connected to real business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind FIG are two people with backgrounds in communications, PR and paid media
          who decided to join forces to build something of their own. We are ambitious,
          hands-on, and genuinely invested in seeing the brands we work with grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          For us, marketing is not just about being seen. It is about being understood,
          remembered and chosen.
